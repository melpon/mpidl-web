-- Static setting below. Changing these requires a recompile

-- | The location of static files on your system. This is a file system
-- path. The default value works properly with your scaffolded site.
staticDir :: FilePath
staticDir = "static"

-- | The base URL for your static files. As you can see by the default
-- value, this can simply be "static" appended to your application root.
-- A powerful optimization can be serving static files from a separate
-- domain name. This allows you to use a web server optimized for static
-- files, more easily set expires and cache values, and avoid possibly
-- costly transference of cookies on static files. For more information,
-- please see:
--   http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/request.html#ServeFromCookielessDomain
--
-- If you change the resource pattern for StaticR in Foundation.hs, you will
-- have to make a corresponding change here.
--
-- To see how this value is used, see urlRenderOverride in Foundation.hs
